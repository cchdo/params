  The API of ``data_type`` has not changed, but your static type checkers might be much happier.

v0.1.13 (2021-08-12)
====================

This release focused mostly on code maintainability. 
Lots of tests written for the public API interface and a whole bunch of improvements to the type hints.

-----------
* A ``WHPName.strfex()`` method was added which formats values passed into it according to the values of ``WHPName.data_type``, ``WHPName.field_width``, and ``WHPName.numeric_precision``. 
  It will convert NaNs, and anything resulting in an empty string to ``-999``. 
  The method name was inspired by the datetime method ``strftime``.

v0.1.11 (2021-05-27)
====================

Parameter Changes

====================

Parameter Changes
-----------------
* Added CTDCT [ITS-90] for calculated conservative temperature from CTD sensors
* Added CTDSA [G/KG] for calculated absolute salinity from CTD sensors

  As of release, there were no "cruise" level parameter names in the database. 
  "profile" scoped parameters can/should be in exchange CTD headers. 
  "sample" scoped params must have their values appear in the data block of an exchange file.
