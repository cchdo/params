  It will convert NaNs, and anything resulting in an empty string to ``-999``. 
  The method name was inspired by the datetime method ``strftime``.

Parameter Changes
-----------------
* Added CTDCT [ITS-90] for calculated conservative temperature from CTD sensors

  As of release, there were no "cruise" level parameter names in the database. 
  "profile" scoped parameters can/should be in exchange CTD headers. 
  "sample" scoped params must have their values appear in the data block of an exchange file.
