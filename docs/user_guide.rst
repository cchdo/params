User Guide
==========
The primary interface are the |WHPNames| and |CFStandardNames| objects.
We will focus mostly on the |WHPNames| object.

The WHPNames Collection
-----------------------

Importing
`````````
The actual database is loaded in a lazy way, so the initial import should be fast. 

>>> from cchdo.params import WHPNames
>>> WHPNames
<cchdo.params._WHPNames object at 0x7f0e853ebac0>


Name Lookups
````````````
These objects follow the standard python Mapping (e.g. dict) interface.
Exchange parameters are looked up by ``(param, unit)`` tuple keys and will always return a |WHPName| object (more on these later).

>>> WHPNames[("CTDPRS", "DBAR")]
WHPName(whp_name='CTDPRS', whp_unit='DBAR', cf_name='sea_water_pressure')

Common unambiguous variations on a parameter name are automatically converted to their canonical representation:

>>> WHPNames[("CTDPRS", "DBARS")]
WHPName(whp_name='CTDPRS', whp_unit='DBAR', cf_name='sea_water_pressure')

If the parameter has no units, use ``None`` in the units part of the tuple.

>>> WHPNames[("EXPOCODE", None)]
WHPName(whp_name='EXPOCODE', whp_unit=None, cf_name=None)

As a connivence, unitless parameters may be looked up via name alone.

>>> WHPNames["EXPOCODE"]
WHPName(whp_name='EXPOCODE', whp_unit=None, cf_name=None)
>>> WHPNames["EXPOCODE"] == WHPNames[("EXPOCODE", None)]
True

.. warning::
  Currently the ``(param, unit)`` tuples are case sensitive.

  >>> WHPNames["ExpoCode"]
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "/workspaces/params/cchdo/params/__init__.py", line 406, in __getitem__
      return self._cached_dict[key]
  KeyError: ('ExpoCode', None)

.. danger::
  The ``units`` part of the key is expected to be the WHP unit for the parameter.
  This may deviate from the actual units associated with the parameters physical dimensions.

  For example, practical salinity is a dimensionless quantity.
  In the SI system this is said to have the unit one with the symbol 1. 
  See section 2.3.3 of [BIPM2019]_.
  You will see the value of 1 in the units attribute of netCDF files.
  However, in WPH Exchange files, the correct unit for practical salinity is PSS-78.

  >>> WHPNames[("CTDSAL", "PSS-78")]
  WHPName(whp_name='CTDSAL', whp_unit='PSS-78', cf_name='sea_water_practical_salinity')
  >>> WHPNames[("CTDSAL", "PSS-78")].cf_unit
  '1'

Dict-like operations
````````````````````

Since |WHPNames| follows the python Mapping interface, you can do all the standard dict operations on it.

Membership tests:

>>> ("CTDSAL", "PSS-78") in WHPNames
True

Dimensionless membership tests also work:

>>> "EXPOCODE" in WHPNames
True

Iterating the keys will always return the keys in their ``(param, unit)`` form.

>>> for key in WHPNames:
...   print(key)
...   break
... 
('EXPOCODE', None)

The views returned by `.items()`, `.values()`, and `.keys()` also work as expected.

.. warning::
  Currently all the alias keys are included with the canonical keys, this may change in the future.
  This means there will be more keys returned than there are actual WHPName values.
  
  >>> len(WHPNames) == len(set(WHPNames.values()))
  False


|WHPName| Groups
````````````````
There are some groupings of parameters that are very useful when translating to netCDF, specifically when determining the shape of the variables.
The idea was as follows: cruise level parameters would be scalar variables, profile level parameters would be single dimensional, and sample level parameters (e.g. bottle sample measurements) would be two or more dimensional.
These groupings are provided by a `.groups` property as a named tuple.

>>> WHPNames.groups
WHPNameGroups(cruise=frozenset(), profile=frozenset( [...]

This named tuple has the names: ``cruise``, ``profile``, and ``sample`` which all contained frozen sets of |WHPName| instances.
